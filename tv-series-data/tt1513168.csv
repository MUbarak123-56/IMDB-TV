Through the Wormhole,6,6,Why Do We Lie?,"Jun 3, 2015",7.4,64,"We all agree lying is shameful. Yet we still deliberately deceive each other constantly. Are our brains wired for lying from a young age? The brains of pathological liars may provide insights. Will technology make it easier for us to be dishonest, or could it someday instantly reveal someone is lying? Perhaps we are deceitful because our limited senses prevent us from seeing the real truth. Scientists say our own memories deceive us, and have managed to implant false memories. Other scientists look for ultimate truth in the subatomic world - only to end up turning ...",tt1513168,
Through the Wormhole,7,1,What Makes a Terrorist?,"Aug 8, 2016",7.3,54,"Terrorists, like any group, have a cause to rally around.
